# Policy settings for commands defined by qtbase. These will also be injected
# into the top level policy scope of each Qt module when building Qt so that
# modules have the same policy settings as qtbase by default. They can be
# overridden by individual Qt modules in their own .cmake.conf files if needed.

# NOTE: These two values are also hard-coded in QtBuildInternalsConfig.cmake
#       because that file is used in-place by a superbuild, so there is no
#       opportunity for substituting the values from here. Keep both locations
#       in sync.
